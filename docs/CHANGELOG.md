## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-04 (PR #7 merged)

### Added — Pact detail screen and persistent pacts panel

- Pact detail screen: stats (done / failed / remaining or cancelled / streak), timeline (start date, end date, days remaining), stop pact with confirmation dialog and optional explanation
- Pact detail screen is accessible for active, stopped, and completed pacts
- Persistent `DraggableScrollableSheet` panel on the dashboard listing all pacts with filter chips (Active / Done / Stopped) and a summary bar
- Tapping a pact tile navigates to its detail screen; returning refreshes both the pact list and the dashboard calendar
- Auto-completion: `PactDetailViewModel.load()` transitions an active pact to `completed` when its end date has passed (`daysLeft ≤ 0`) or all showups are resolved
- Locale-aware date and time formatting throughout (EN / FR / DE)
- Localised section headers (Stats, Timeline, Stop reason) in all three locales
- New l10n keys: `sectionStats`, `sectionTimeline`, `sectionStopReason`, `stopPactError`, `pactsActive`, `pactsDone`, `pactsCancelled`, `addPact`, `pactListTitle`, `filterActive`, `filterDone`, `filterCancelled`, `pactNextShowup`, `pactEndedOn`, `pactCancelledOn`

### Fixed

- `stopError` now displayed to the user when stopping a pact fails
- `TextEditingController` in stop dialogs wrapped in `try/finally` to guarantee disposal
- `assert(pact != null && stats != null)` added to `_PactDetailContent.build` on both platforms; defensive null guard retained for release mode
- Removed duplicate `pactListViewModelProvider.load()` — `DashboardScreen` owns all cold-start loads; `PactsPanel` is a pure observer
- Chevron removed from dashboard showup tiles (showup detail screen not yet implemented)
- Dashboard `getAllPacts()` used instead of `getActivePacts()` so pact names remain available across status transitions

### Tests

- 3 new tests for auto-completion: expired end date, all showups resolved, no-op (active with pending showups)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-03 (PR #5 merged)

### Added — Pact count warning and calendar dot layout

- Warning dialog before pact creation when the user already has 3 or more active pacts; plural-aware copy in EN/FR/DE
- iOS warning uses `CupertinoAlertDialog`; Android uses `AlertDialog`
- Crossfade animation when switching days in the calendar strip
- iOS nav-bar `+` button hidden on empty state (matching Android FAB behaviour)
- New l10n keys: `cancel`, `tooManyPactsTitle`, `tooManyPactsBody` (plural), `tooManyPactsConfirm`

### Changed — Calendar strip dot layout

- 1 showup → 1 dot; 2 → 2 dots on one row; 3 → 2+1 rows; 4+ → single large overflow dot
- Overflow dot colour: grey while any showup is still pending; green if all resolved and done ≥ failed; red if failed > done
- Overflow dot key includes date (`status-dot-overflow-YYYY-MM-DD`) to prevent key collisions across the 7-day strip

### Fixed

- TOCTOU race: `_creatingPact` flag prevents double-tap from bypassing the pact count guard
- `onCreatePact` typed as `AsyncCallback` so exceptions after `await` are not silently dropped
- `hasActivePactsProvider` now invalidated on return from pact creation via the warning-dialog path

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-03 (PR #4 merged)

### Added — Dashboard wiring

- Showups are now generated and persisted when a pact is created via `PactCreationViewModel.submit()`
- `pactCreationShowupRepositoryProvider` — new Riverpod provider for the showup repository used during pact creation
- `deletePact(String id)` added to `PactRepository` interface and `InMemoryPactRepository`
- Shared `InMemoryShowupRepository` instance wired between dashboard and pact creation in `main.dart`
- Integration test: submit pact → load dashboard → assert showups appear in `calendarDays`

### Fixed

- `endDate` overflow: replaced `DateTime(today.year, today.month + 6, today.day)` with month-overflow-safe `_addMonths()` that clamps the day to the last day of the target month
- iOS `CupertinoDatePicker` assertion: `initial date not >= minimumDate` — strip time component from today when used as `minimumDate`
- iOS modal pickers: Done button no longer cut off by home indicator — switched to `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` + `SizedBox(height: viewPadding.bottom)` instead of a fixed calculated container height; applied to all pickers in pact duration and schedule steps
- Orphaned pact rollback: `saveShowups` failure now triggers `deletePact` to clean up; failure is surfaced via `submitError`; masking risk documented as tech debt

### Tests

- `pact_creation_view_model_test.dart`: added showup repo override to all containers, 3 new tests (generates showups, skips showups on pact failure, sets error on showup failure)
- `pact_creation_state_test.dart`: end-of-month edge cases for `_addMonths`

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-?? (PR #3 merged)

### Added — Showup domain layer

- `Showup` model with `id`, `pactId`, `scheduledAt`, `duration`, `status`, and optional `note`
- `ShowupStatus` enum: `pending`, `done`, `failed`
- `ShowupGenerator` — deterministically generates all `Showup` instances for a pact from its `ShowupSchedule`
- `ShowupRepository` interface and `InMemoryShowupRepository` implementation
- `ShowupDateUtils` — helpers for date arithmetic used during generation
- `SaveShowupsResult` — result type returned when persisting a batch of showups
- `PactStats` — computed stats for a pact: made, failed, remaining, and current streak
- Showups are generated and persisted automatically when a pact is created via `PactCreationViewModel`

---

## [0.0.2] — 2026-02-?? (PR #1 merged)

### Added — Pact creation wizard

- 5-step wizard: commitment confirmation → habit name → pact duration → showup duration → schedule → reminder
- `ShowupSchedule` supporting three modes: every day at a time, specific weekdays, specific days of the month
- `PactCreationState` and `PactCreationViewModel` (Riverpod notifier) managing wizard state
- `PactRepository` interface and `InMemoryPactRepository` implementation
- `Pact` model and `PactStatus` enum (`active`, `stopped`, `completed`)
- Platform-split UI: separate iOS (`CupertinoPageScaffold`) and Android (`Scaffold`) widgets for each step
- Fix: schedule step no longer loses entered entries when navigating back

### Added — Dashboard

- Dashboard screen with a 7-day calendar strip (3 days before / today / 3 days after)
- Today's showup list placeholder (empty state)
- Platform-split UI: `DashboardPageIos` and `DashboardPageAndroid`
- `DashboardState` and `DashboardViewModel`

---

## [0.0.1] — 2026-01-?? (initial scaffold)

### Added

- Flutter project scaffold targeting iOS and Android
- Riverpod for state management and dependency injection
- sqflite dependency for local storage (not yet used)
- Localizations in English, French, and German (`flutter gen-l10n`, output to `lib/l10n/generated/`)
- `analysis_options.yaml` with `package:flutter_lints`
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions): test → resolve-version → build-android / build-ios → distribute → version tag
