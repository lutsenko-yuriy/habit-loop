## v0.11.0 — UI polish & pre-1.0 cleanup

### Issues

- [HAB-17](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-17/refactor-replace-pactcreationstate-with-a-pactbuilder) **Refactor: replace PactCreationState with a PactBuilder** — `PactCreationState` mixes wizard navigation state with pact-building data. Extract a `PactBuilder` class that holds only the pact fields and exposes a `build()` method returning a `Pact`. (Tech Debt)

## v1.0.0 — SQLite persistence + pre-persistence cleanup

### Issues

- [HAB-16](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-16/tech-debt-rollback-exception-masks-original-error-in-pact-creation) **Tech debt: rollback exception masks original error in pact creation** — Resolved as part of HAB-11: wrap pact and showup inserts in a single `db.transaction()` via `savePactWithShowups()`. (Tech Debt — blocked by HAB-11)

### Remaining work

- [HAB-11](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-11/sqlite-persistence-replace-in-memory-repositories) **SQLite persistence — replace in-memory repositories** — Replace `InMemoryPactRepository` and `InMemoryShowupRepository` with real `sqflite` implementations so pacts and showups survive app restarts. The SQLite class should implement both repository interfaces and expose a `savePactWithShowups()` transactional method, fixing the rollback tech debt. (Feature)

## v1.1.0 — Notifications, reminders, and dashboard auto-refresh

### Issues

- [HAB-22](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-22/auto-refresh-dashboard-when-date-changes-at-midnight) **Auto-refresh dashboard when date changes at midnight** — `nowProvider` is evaluated once and not invalidated while the app stays open; after midnight the calendar strip still shows the previous day as "today" and new showups are not generated until relaunch. On foreground resume, invalidate `nowProvider` if the date has changed; stretch goal: midnight background trigger coordinated with HAB-13. (Tech Debt / Feature — blocked by HAB-13)

### Remaining work

- [HAB-13](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-13/notifications-and-reminders) **Notifications and reminders** — Schedule local notifications when a reminder offset is configured during pact creation. Stretch goal: actionable notifications on iOS and Android so the user can mark a showup as done without opening the app. Coordinate with lazy showup generation. (Feature)
- [HAB-21](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-21/auto-fail-past-due-showups-on-dashboard-load) **Auto-fail past-due showups on dashboard load** — When the dashboard loads or refreshes, any showup whose scheduled window has passed (`now > scheduledAt + duration`) and is still `pending` should be automatically transitioned to `failed` and persisted. (Feature — blocked by HAB-13)

## Unscheduled

### Remaining work

- [HAB-40](https://linear.app/iurii-lutsenkos-workspace/issue/HAB-40/in-app-language-selection-without-leaving-the-app) **In-app language selection without leaving the app** — Add an in-app language selector so any user can switch between English, French, and German without going to system Settings. (Feature)
