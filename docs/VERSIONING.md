# Versioning

The app follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the Flutter version format `X.Y.Z+buildNumber` in `pubspec.yaml`.

**Version name (`X.Y.Z`):**
- **Major (X)** — breaking changes (incompatible file format, dropped platform support)
- **Minor (Y)** — new features (new counter operations, new platform support, new UI capabilities)
- **Patch (Z)** — bug fixes and small improvements

Version name changes are manual and require reasoning presented to the user before bumping.

**Build number (`+N`):**
- Auto-incremented by CI only on the `main` branch, after each pipeline run where at least one platform build succeeds.
- Synchronized across Android and iOS — both platforms always use the same build number.
- The CI commit message includes `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loops.
- Feature branch builds do not bump the version, create tags, or distribute to Firebase.
- A `resolve-version` job runs before builds to prevent build number conflicts: it compares the `pubspec.yaml` build number against the highest existing `version-*` git tag and uses whichever is greater. Both platform builds receive this resolved number via `--build-number`.

**Git tags:** Created automatically by CI in the format `version-{X.Y.Z}-{buildNumber}-{suffix}` where suffix is:
- `both` — both Android and iOS builds distributed
- `android` — only Android distributed
- `ios` — only iOS distributed
- `none` — builds succeeded but distribution was intentionally skipped (no `[user]` or `[app]` change in this CHANGELOG entry)

**CI/CD pipeline structure:**
```
check-skip → test → resolve-version → build-android → distribute-android ─┐
                                     → build-ios     → distribute-ios     ──┤
                                                                            └→ version-tag (if ≥1 build succeeded)
```

Distribution and version tagging only run on the `main` branch. Feature branches can still build (useful for testing) but won't distribute or tag.

**Selective distribution:** `resolve-version` runs `scripts/changelog/distribute.py` to check whether the new CHANGELOG entries contain any `[user]` or `[app]` bullets. If not (e.g. a `[meta]`-only or `[ci]`-only entry), the `distribute-android` and `distribute-ios` jobs are skipped. The build still compiles, the build number is still bumped, and a `version-*-none` git tag is created — keeping build numbers monotonic.

**`[wip]` entries skip the build entirely** (unlike `[meta]`/`[ci]` which still compile and create a `version-*-none` tag). No binary is produced, no tag is created. CI pipeline changes to enforce the build skip are tracked separately; for now the tag documents the intent and lint enforces its use. Because no `version-*` tag is created for `[wip]` entries, `release_notes.py` automatically includes all `[user]` bullets from those and any subsequent entries when the next distributable build runs — preserving "What's New" aggregation across all unpublished releases.

**CHANGELOG tag taxonomy** (enforced by `scripts/changelog/lint.py`):

| Tag | Meaning | Triggers distribution? | Release notes? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[user]` | User-visible app change | Yes | Yes |
| `[app]` | App code change, not user-visible | Yes | No |
| `[test]` | Test-only changes (unit tests, scenarios, widget tests) — no production code | No | No |
| `[meta]` | Skills / agent / workflow change | No | No |
| `[ci]` | CI/CD process change | No | No |
| `[user-none]` | Entire entry is internal-only (legacy sentinel) | No | No |
| `[wip]` | Intermediate WU merge in a multi-WU ticket — tests run, builds and distribution entirely skipped, no `version-*` tag created | No | No |
| `[non-user]` | Supplementary bullet descriptor (not a classification) | — | No |

Every new `## [X.Y.Z]` entry must carry at least one classification tag (`[user]`, `[app]`, `[test]`, `[meta]`, `[ci]`, or `[user-none]`). The tag list may be extended; each new tag must declare its distribution and release-note behaviour.

**Release notes ("What's New"):**
- `scripts/changelog/release_notes.py` is run during `resolve-version` to produce user-friendly bullet-point release notes.
- It parses `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, extracts all entries with a version number *higher* than the last published version (determined from `version-*` git tags), and strips developer-only references (HAB-XX issue numbers, PR #XX, WU work-unit markers).
- Only `[user]` bullets are included; all other tags are silently excluded.
- Output is capped at 4 000 characters for compatibility with both Firebase App Distribution and App Store "What's New" fields.
- The generated notes are passed to both `distribute-android` and `distribute-ios` via a job output and written to `--release-notes-file` so Firebase testers see human-readable text instead of a build number/SHA string.
- A copy of the notes file is uploaded as a `release-notes` GitHub Actions artifact (retained for 90 days) for manual use in App Store / Play Store submissions.

**On-demand build cleanup:**
- Run `/cleanup-firebase [N] [--dry-run]` from Claude Code (skill: `skills/manage/cleanup-firebase/SKILL.md`).
- Deletes all Firebase App Distribution releases for both Android and iOS except the most recent N (default 10).
- Runs locally via `scripts/firebase/cleanup_builds.py` using `gcloud auth print-access-token` for authentication.
- Requires: `gcloud` CLI authenticated, `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID` and `FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID` set in the environment.
