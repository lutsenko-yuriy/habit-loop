# Versioning

The app follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the Flutter version format `X.Y.Z+buildNumber` in `pubspec.yaml`.

**Version name (`X.Y.Z`):**
- **Major (X)** — breaking changes (incompatible file format, dropped platform support)
- **Minor (Y)** — new features (new counter operations, new platform support, new UI capabilities)
- **Patch (Z)** — bug fixes and small improvements

Version name changes are manual and require reasoning presented to the user before bumping.

**Build number (`+N`):**
- Auto-incremented by CI only on the `main` branch, after each pipeline run where at least one platform build succeeds.
- Synchronized across Android and iOS — both platforms always use the same build number.
- The CI commit message includes `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loops.
- Feature branch builds do not bump the version, create tags, or distribute to Firebase.
- A `resolve-version` job runs before builds to prevent build number conflicts: it compares the `pubspec.yaml` build number against the highest existing `version-*` git tag and uses whichever is greater. Both platform builds receive this resolved number via `--build-number`.

**Git tags:** Created automatically by CI in the format `version-{X.Y.Z}-{buildNumber}-{suffix}` where suffix is:
- `both` — both Android and iOS builds succeeded
- `android` — only Android succeeded
- `ios` — only iOS succeeded

**CI/CD pipeline structure:**
```
check-skip → test → resolve-version → build-android → distribute-android ─┐
                                     → build-ios     → distribute-ios     ──┤
                                                                            └→ version-tag (if ≥1 build succeeded)
```

Distribution and version tagging only run on the `main` branch. Feature branches can still build (useful for testing) but won't distribute or tag.

**Release notes ("What's New"):**
- `scripts/generate_release_notes.py` is run during `resolve-version` to produce user-friendly bullet-point release notes.
- It parses `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, extracts all entries with a version number *higher* than the last published version (determined from `version-*` git tags), and strips developer-only references (HAB-XX issue numbers, PR #XX, WU work-unit markers).
- Output is capped at 4 000 characters for compatibility with both Firebase App Distribution and App Store "What's New" fields.
- The generated notes are passed to both `distribute-android` and `distribute-ios` via a job output and written to `--release-notes-file` so Firebase testers see human-readable text instead of a build number/SHA string.
- A copy of the notes file is uploaded as a `release-notes` GitHub Actions artifact (retained for 90 days) for manual use in App Store / Play Store submissions.
